## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This Github account hosts one code repository per paper for Bruce Lab publications and preprints where code needs to be made available.

If you are looking for something for a particular paper you can browse through the repos or use the search bar (select the 'organization' scope).

### Naming conventions

Repos are named `{first_author}_{preprint_year}`.  If there are multiple publications with the same identifier then `[a-z]` will be appended.

Repo descriptions contain the title of the preprint.

Repo README.md files contain the full title, author list, and DOI.
